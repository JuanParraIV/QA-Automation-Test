- Helps in identifying bottleneck or performance issues.
- Also helps in determining infraestructure requirements.
- Done by specialized performance monitoring tools.
    - Agent based
    - Agent less
- Tools: DynaTrace, AppDynamics, NewRelic, SiteScope, etc.

## Important metrics to Monitor
- **Web Server:** CPU Utilization, Memory Utilization, Disk I/O, Requests per second, etc.
- **App Server:** CPU Utilization, Memory Utilization, Processing time, Deadlock, Requests per second, etc.
- **Database Server:** CPU Utilization, Memory Utilization, Query processing time, etc.
