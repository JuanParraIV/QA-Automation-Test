# Fundamental of Software Testing

## What is Software Testing?

- Software testing is defined as an activity to check whether the actual results match the expected results.
- It ensures that the software system is defect-free.
- The key goals of software testing are cost-effectiveness, security, product quality, and customer satisfaction.

Software Testing is a process used to identify:
- Correctness
- Completeness
- Quality of developed software

Software Testing includes:
- Set of activities conducted with the intent of finding errors in software.
- Checking that the product works properly before release to end-users.

## Testing

Testing is a critical element of software development life cycles. It is also called software quality control or software quality assurance. The basic goals of testing are validation and verification:

- Validation: Are we building the right product?
- Verification: Does "X" meet its specification?
  - "X" can be code, a model, a design diagram, a requirement, etc.

At each stage, we need to verify that the thing we produce accurately represents its specification.

## Terminology

- Error:
  - Mistake made by an engineer.
  - Often a misunderstanding of requirements or design specifications.

- Fault:
  - Manifestation of that error in the code.
  - What we often call a bug.

- Failure:
  - Incorrect output.
  - Program behavior is not proper and may be caused by a fault.

- Testing:
  - Failures in software.
  - Debugging attempts to associate failures with faults so that they can be removed from the system.

## Purpose of Software Testing

The goal of a software tester is:
- To find bugs.
- To find them as early as possible.
- To ensure they get fixed.

Testing is a means to:
- Find bugs.
- Provide confidence and information.
- Even prevent defects.

## What Methods are used to conduct testing?

There are five basic verification methods, as outlined below:

## Who makes a good tester?

A tester's mindset must have the following attributes:

## Testing Profession

Key aspects of the testing profession:

- Fun to break code.
- Rewarded for finding faults.
- Strong Domain Expertise / Business knowledge.
- Market Trend - Buy vs Build.
- Automation - Paves the way for being involved in all phases of SDLC.
- Competency Development - Test Architects / Consultants.
- "Sure Fire" Career path.

## Principles of software testing

1. Testing shows the presence of defects.
2. Exhaustive testing is impossible.
3. Early testing.
4. Defect Clustering.
5. Pesticide Paradox.
6. Testing is context-dependent.
7. Absence of error - fallacy.
