## Real World Application Usage

## Think Time
- A delay between two transactions
- Used in test script to simulate real world application usage scenario
- Helps in simulating production like conditions
- Also avoids overwhelming like conditions
- Added between two transactions.
    - Think time count = Number of Transactions - 1
- Two types of Think Times:
    - Fixed
    - Dynamic (Recommended)

 ## Pacing
 - Delay between two iterations
 - Allows the performance test to simulate the time gap between two sessions
 - Helps in achieving the desired load on application by regulating rate of requests
